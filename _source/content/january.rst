It has been a number of months since the last commits were recorded. 
Many of you requested that we just keep going each month. While we
like that you had so much fun we thought it was best to make it a
little more special. But open source software moves so fast once a year
just doesn't cut it, so we have decided to bring back the fun for
the January edition of Julython. 

Like many of you we have been busy doing other things and not working
on the site. We want to open up to you our users to see how we can
attract more people and projects to play along.
